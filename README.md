Remote Backup-Scripts
==============

A Bash sciprt used to backup several servers and DBs to a Netgear Stora.

Since the Sotra is behind a firewall and may need to be moved physically at any time 
I decided to "pull" backups from the hosted servers rahter than push them.  I then 
placed them in dedicated directories and gave them time/date stamped names.

It is important to note that root access to the stora and an ssh identity are required.


Identification of problems or any suggested improvements are welcome.
